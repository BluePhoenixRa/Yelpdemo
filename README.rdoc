== README

Yelp like site made with Ruby on Rails, based on the tutorials by Alex Yang of BaseRails.com

The app can be seen live at: http://ra-yelp.herokuapp.com/

Make yourself an account and have at it!

Known issues (that I'm still working on):
- Search does not work on production environment, but works fully on localhost
- No Admin panel
